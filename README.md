# Coverage Upload Action

Upload code coverage data to a remote server

## Overview

This action will display the current coverage on any pull requests. You can also provide a remote endpoint to receive the coverage data and respond with the difference in coverage between the current branch and base branch.

The pull request comment contains the following information:

```txt
|           | Hit | Found | Percentage | Difference |
| --------- | --- | ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Lines     |     |       |            |            |
| Functions |     |       |            |            |
| Branches  |     |       |            |            |
```

If you don't send the data to a remote endpoint the difference column will not be shown.

## Usage

In your `.github/workflows` directory make a new workflow file that runs on pull requests and pushes to the default branch.

```yml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    types: ['opened', 'reopened', 'synchronize']
  push:
    branches: ['master']

jobs:
  title:
    name: run tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test
        run: npm test -- --coverage
      - name: Upload coverage
        uses: neofinancial/coverage-action
        with:
          coverageEndpoint: https://your.endpoint.here
          coverageToken: ${{ secrets.COVERAGE_TOKEN }}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

If you have an existing workflow that runs your tests you can just add the `Upload coverage` step at the end of that workflow.

## Settings

| Name             | Description                                                            | Default              | Required |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- |
| coverageData     | The location of the lcov file containing coverage information          | `coverage/lcov.info` | No       |
| coverageEndpoint | The remote endpoint to upload coverage data to                         |                      | No       |
| coverageToken    | A token to authenticate with the remote endpoint and identify the repo |                      | No       |

This action also can accept a markdown comment . Modify your workflow like so:

```yml
  customMessage:
     description: toggle if the coverageEndpoint expects to respond with the custom message or just the difference
     default: 'comment'
     required: false
```

## REST API Message Format

This action will send a POST request to the specified endpoint with a message that looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": 218177808,
  "actor": "a-github-user",
  "hash": "3ba1efac955942305a038ba37d25e20b4d2092e6",
  "baseRef": "master",
  "ref": "my-branch",
  "functionsHit": 10,
  "functionsTotal": 20,
  "linesHit": 77,
  "linesTotal": 101,
  "branchesHit": 19,
  "branchesTotal": 23,
  "token": "secret"
}
```

The `id` field is the GitHub repository ID and is added automatically. The `token` field is the token generated by your API service to authenticate and identify the repository.

The action expects to receive a response to this message that looks like this:

```json
{
  "lineDifference": 12.2,
  "functionDifference": 7.78,
  "branchDifference": -2.5
}
```

These values are the % change in coverage for a particular metric and will be displayed in the `difference` column in the comment posted by the action.
